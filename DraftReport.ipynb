    "## Introduction\n",
    "Mushrooms are a type of fungus found in many, if not all, parts of the world, that have been used throughout history in a variety of fields. Fungi are extracted for both their beneficial and harmful properties. There is an entire subsector of biology dedicated to studying how mushrooms develop and evolve. After searching, we decided to focus on a specific set found on the UCI website due to the variety of attributes in the report. \n",

    "### Data Background\n",
    "<p align=\"justify\">The data we have selected to study is the analysis of 23 different gilled mushroom species of the *Agaricus* and *Lepiota* Families. Originally, this was collected in order to discover a more efficient and accurate way to tell if a mushroom is edible or poisonous as part of a field guide. This information was found on the UCI, collected by The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms (1981), and donated by Jeff Schlimmer.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "The Aubudon Society collects information on over 700 different species of North American Mushrooms and compiles them in a concise and easy to understand handbook. Every aspect of a mushroom is detailed as to make it as simple as possible for anyone to differentiate one in the field. \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "We believe that this information could be used to create an effective classifier.  All of the attributes, excluding poisonousness, are easy observable, and have a high correlation with whether or not a mushroom is poisonous or edible.  \n",

    "### Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "This kind of information is vital to many industries, ranging from tourism to healthcare. Having the knowledge of whether a mushroom is usable or not could save a starving hiker's life or speed up the process of developing medicines involving those materials. Although most poisonous mushrooms only cause minor symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhea, children or animals can develop symptoms such organ damage and, in some cases, death. The field is currently based on a lot of guesswork and tedious work, and even professional mushroomers can misidentify a specimen.\n",

    "The data we have selected to study is the analysis of 23 different gilled mushroom species of the *Agaricus* and *Lepiota* Families. Originally, this was collected in order to discover a more efficient and accurate way to tell if a mushroom is edible or poisonous as part of a field guide. This information was found on the UCI, collected The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms (1981), and donated by Jeff Schlimmer.\n",

    "This kind of information is vital to many industries, ranging from tourism to healthcare. Having the knowledge of whether a mushroom is usable or not could save a starving hiker's life or speed up the process of developing medicines involving those materials. Although most poisonous mushrooms only cause minor symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhea, children or animals can develop symptoms such organ damage and, in some cases, death. The field is currently based on a lot of guesswork and tedious work, and even professional mushroomers can misidentify a specimen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since one of our 22 categorical data attributes is a binary type representing if a mushroom is poisonous or edible, we can use this information to check our accuracy. We plan to correlate each attribute to either type and see if there is a strong relation between any of them that could be used to accurately predict the mushroom's edibleness. \n",

    "Mushrooms are a type of fungus found in many, if not all, parts of the world, and has been used throughout history in a variety of fields. These fungi are extracted for both their beneficial and harmful properties, and such, they are in constant demand. There is an entire subsect of biology dedicated to studying how mushrooms develop and evolve, providing us with as much data as we could want. After searching, we decided to focus on a specific set found on the UCI website, due to the variety of attributes in the report. \n",

    "### Data Background\n",
    "<p align=\"justify\">The data we have selected to study is the analysis of 23 different gilled mushroom species of the *Agaricus* and *Lepiota* Families. Originally, this was collected in order to discover a more efficient and accurate way to tell if a mushroom is edible or poisonous as part of a field guide. This information was found on the UCI, collected The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms (1981), and donated by Jeff Schlimmer.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "The Aubudon Society collects information on over 700 different species of North American Mushrooms and compiles them in a concise and easy to understand handbook. Every aspect of a mushroom is detailed as to make it as simple as possible for anyone to differentiate one in the field. </p>\n"

    "### Purpose\n",
    "This kind of information is vital to many industries, ranging from tourism to healthcare. Having the knowledge of whether a mushroom is usable or not could save a starving hiker's life or speed up the process of developing medicines involving those materials. Although most poisonous mushrooms only cause minor symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhea, children or animals can develop symptoms such organ damage and, in some cases, death. The field is currently based on a lot of guesswork and tedious work, and even professional mushroomers can misidentify a specimen.\n",
